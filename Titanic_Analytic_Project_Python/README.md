About this project

Project Overview
This project explored the Titanic passenger dataset to identify the key socio-economic and demographic factors that influenced survival during the 1912 maritime disaster. Using Python’s data analysis and visualization libraries, the team performed comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and survival analysis to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset.

Conclusion
Socio-economic status, gender, and family presence were the most significant determinants of survival. The analysis confirmed that women, children, and wealthier passengers had higher survival probabilities due to social norms and cabin access advantages.
