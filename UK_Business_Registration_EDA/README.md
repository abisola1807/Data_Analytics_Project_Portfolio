About this project

This project was completed as part of a structured data analysis task. The core objective was to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on anonymised UK company registration records spanning 2021–2025. The analysis focused on uncovering trends in new company formations, turnover levels, and business closures across multiple sectors of the UK economy.

Using a combination of statistical exploration and visual analytics, I identified year-over-year shifts, sector-specific performance trends, and indicators of emerging or declining business activity. The findings were presented through clear visualisations and summarised insights suitable for stakeholder reporting.
