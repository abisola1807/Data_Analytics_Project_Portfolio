EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD 
1. Overview 
This HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce composition, 
attrition patterns, demographic trends, employee satisfaction, and behavioural drivers across a 
dataset of 1,470 employees. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making that improves 
retention, workforce planning, employee engagement, and organisational performance. 
2. Key Workforce Metrics 
KPI 
Value Interpretation 
Total Headcount 1470 Large, diverse workforce 
Active Employees 1233 
Attrition Rate 
Majority retained 
16.12% Slightly above industry benchmark (10–15%) 
Average Tenure 7 years Strong employee longevity 
Average Age 
38 
Mid-career workforce 
Insight: Workforce stability is reasonable, but attrition remains a concern that requires targeted 
interventions. 
3. Major Attrition Drivers 
a. Business Travel 
• Frequent travelers show the highest attrition (24.91%).  
• Rare travelers show moderate attrition. 
• Non-travelers have lowest attrition. 
Interpretation: 
Travel demands may cause burnout, work-life imbalance, or job dissatisfaction. 
b. Job Involvement 
Attrition decreases sharply as involvement increases: 
Job Involvement Attrition Rate 
Level 1 
Level 2 
Level 3 
Level 4 
Interpretation: 
~34% 
~19% 
~14% 
~9% 
Employees who feel less connected to their work are 3× more likely to leave. This suggests gaps 
in engagement, recognition, or role clarity. 
c. Job Role 
Highest attrition is found in: 
• Sales Representatives (40 %) 
• Laboratory Technicians (24 %) 
• Customer-facing or high-pressure roles (HR Roles 23%) 
Lowest attrition appears in managerial and director-level roles. 
Interpretation: 
High-demand, low-control positions face the greatest turnover risk. 
d. Age Band 
• Under 25s have the highest attrition (~40%). 
• Employees aged 35–44 have the lowest attrition (~10%). 
• Attrition rises again for employees over 55. 
Interpretation: 
Younger employees may seek better opportunities and career acceleration. 
Older employees may be transitioning out due to retirement or role fatigue/ Medical condition. 


4. Employee Experience Insights 
Job Satisfaction Score: 2.73 / 4 
This reflects moderate satisfaction, below the “Satisfied” threshold (3.0). 
Interpretation: 
There is room for improvement in areas such as career progression, recognition, role clarity, and 
work-life balance. 
Refined Business Insights to Major Contributor of Attrition 
1. Travel-related roles cause burnout which in turn contributes to attrition. 
2. Low job involvement strongly predicts turnover; engagement strategies are needed. 
3. Younger employees are at high risk and may require targeted development programs. 
4. Sales and Operational roles face high turnover and require job redesign or incentive 
reviews. 
5. Moderate job satisfaction highlights cultural or engagement challenges that may worsen 
attrition if not addressed. 

Strategic Recommendations 
1. Reduce travel burden 
2. Evaluate travel frequency, provide rotation, increase support, or offer hybrid alternatives. 
3. Strengthen job involvement  
(Manager coaching, recognition programs, clearer career paths). 
4. Target early-career employees  
(Improved onboarding, mentorship, and growth opportunities). 
5. Review high-attrition job roles  
(Assess workload, compensation competitiveness, role clarity, and training support). 
6. Improve overall job satisfaction 
(Conduct pulse surveys, enhance communication, and foster a stronger employee experience 
culture.) 

Conclusion 
The HR Analytics Dashboard demonstrates that attrition is driven by specific behavioural, 
demographic, and role-based factors. Addressing these targeted areas will reduce turnover, 
strengthen engagement, and improve overall workforce stability. The insights here position HR to 
make high-impact, data-driven decisions.
